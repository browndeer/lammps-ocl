LAMMPS-OCL is an experimental version of the LAMMPS molecular dynamics code
cloned from the LAMMPS project git repository on 22 March 2011.

The purpose of this version is to provide a testbed for experimenting
with OpenCL modifications to allow the simulations to run on modern
multi-core (CPU) and many-core (GPU) devices using OpenCL.

This version of LAMMPS is *NOT* a subsititute for the production code
available from the LAMMPS project website: http://lammps.sandia.gov

LAMMPS-OCL has been tested on the following graphics cards:
AMD Radeon HD 6970
AMD/ATI FirePro V8800
NVIDIA Tesla C2070

A white paper describing the initial investigation using this experimental
version of LAMMPS can be found here:

The modifications in LAMMPS-OCL were developed by Brown Deer Technology, LLC.

LAMMPS-OCL presently requires:
(1) an OpenCL implementation suitable for your system
(2) COPRTHR SDK v1.2 (pre-release) which may found on the "current" branch of
    the development (www.github.com/browndeer/coprthr)
    
The LAMMPS-OCL source code including all modifications is available under
the GPLv2 license of the original LAMMPS code.

The following information describes the original production code, with
more information available from the project's webpage:

LAMMPS stands for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator.
